**Here is my simple and clean niri dotfiles setup for Arch linux based distros.**

Here is my install script.

<pre>git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/visnudeva/Niri-dot-files.git ~/Niri-dot-files
cd ~/Niri-dot-files
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh</pre>

To turn on the dark theme use the already installed gtk settings software

Now you can logout and login on Niri.

The keyboard layout is US but it can also be changed in the niri config file.

The main keybindings are:
     
    - Mod+T kitty (terminal)
    - Mod+I geany (IDE)
    - Mod+M fuzzel (launcher)
    - Mod+W firefox (web browser)
    - Mod+F thunar (file browser)
    - Mod+L hyprlock (lock)
    - Mod+E Exit (logout)
